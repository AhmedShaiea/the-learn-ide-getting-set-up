## A Quick Note on the Learn IDE
The Learn IDE  basically gives you a pre-configured terminal with a complete development environment in about a minute. We built the Learn IDE so you can get started coding for real without the hassle of getting your entire computer setup. The Learn IDE is built on top of Atom, the text editor by our amazing friends over at GitHub.
